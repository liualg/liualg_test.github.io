# Welcome

My name is Alexander, and I am currently doing neuro-psychology research involving taste. Please look around and enjoy yourself.

### Current Project: 

I am currently researching taste semantics in the human language. I hope to relate the neural correlates of the taste pathway to the colexification --  describes the case when different meanings can be expressed by the same word in a language, of words in human languages.

#### Taste Quality Representation in the Human Brain
In this study, I examined the spatial representation of taste within the human brain. My analyses revealed tastes activate the primary taste cortex, but did not show a consistent preference for any individual taste. However, a multivariate searchlight analyses reliably decoded the identity of distinct tastes within the primary taste cortex. These results suggest that taste quality is not represented topographically, but by a distributed population code, both within primary taste cortex as well as regions involved in processing the hedonic and aversive properties of taste.
