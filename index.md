# Welcome

My name is Alexander, and I am currently working at the National Institutes of Cancer in the Serological Sciences Network (SeroNet) project! It is a coordinated effort to expand the nation’s capacity for SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing on a population-level and advance research on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination among diverse and vulnerable populations. Please look around and enjoy yourself.

#### Taste Quality Representation in the Human Brain
In this study, I examined the spatial representation of taste within the human brain. My analyses revealed tastes activate the primary taste cortex, but did not show a consistent preference for any individual taste. However, a multivariate searchlight analyses reliably decoded the identity of distinct tastes within the primary taste cortex. These results suggest that taste quality is not represented topographically, but by a distributed population code, both within primary taste cortex as well as regions involved in processing the hedonic and aversive properties of taste.
