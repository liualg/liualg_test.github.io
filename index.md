# Welcome

My name is Alexander, and I am currently doing neuro-psychology research involving taste. Please look around and enjoy yourself. 

## Current Project: 

I am currently researching taste semantics in the human language. I hope to relate the neural correlates of the taste pathway to the colexification --  describes the case when different meanings can be expressed by the same word in a language, of words in human languages.
